# Contributing to `elnora-slack`

Thanks for your interest. This project is open to community contributions.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Open an issue using the appropriate template:

- **Bug report** — something doesn't work, or works differently than documented
- **Feature request** — a new command, skill, or capability you'd find useful

Please search existing issues first so we can avoid duplicates.

## Pull Requests

PRs are welcome from anyone. The Elnora engineering team reviews and merges.

Before opening a PR:

1. Open an issue first if the change is non-trivial — saves you time if we'd prefer a different approach.
2. Fork the repo, create a feature branch off `main`.
3. Match the existing style (Biome enforces formatting; `pnpm lint:fix` cleans it up).
4. Add tests (Vitest) for new behavior.
5. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in your PR title — Release Please uses these to generate version bumps and changelog entries.
6. Run the full local check before pushing:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm lint
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm test
   pnpm build
   node scripts/check-no-populated-references.mjs
   ```
7. Open the PR against `main`. CI runs automatically; an Elnora maintainer will review.

## A note on generated command files

`src/commands/*.ts` are generated from the Slack OpenAPI spec by `src/generate.ts`.
If you regenerate them (`pnpm generate`), run `pnpm lint:fix` afterward so the
output matches Biome's formatting. Hand-authored additions must live between
`// BEGIN MANUAL` and `// END MANUAL` markers to survive regeneration.
